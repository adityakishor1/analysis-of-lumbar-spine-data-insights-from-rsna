# Analysis of Lumbar Spine Data - Insights from RSNA

This project is based on the RSNA competition dataset focused on lumbar spine conditions. The goal is to analyze and extract insights from the data to improve understanding and diagnosis of spine issues. By applying various machine learning techniques, this project aims to build predictive models and identify patterns in lumbar spine health.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Insightful visualizations and statistical analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predictive models for lumbar spine conditions.
  
## Tools & Libraries:
- **Python**: Core programming language used.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model building.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization.
